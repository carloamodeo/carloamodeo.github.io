            <h2>About Me</h2>
            
            <p>I am an <span style="color: white;">algorithms engineer</span> at neuro42, a medtech ULF MRI startup based in SF, California. 
                I am passionate about technology, and in particular about how this can be used to improve people's lives.
                <br><br>
                As an engineer with expertise in signal processing, my impact can be huge in the field of diagnosis, whether it is through <span style="color: white;">medical imaging</span> technologies or through <span style="color: white;">wearable devices</span>. Thanks to my double Master's obtained between Italy and US I have a deep understanding of the weaknesses and the strengths of the medical device strategies in the two continents.
                <br><br>
                My expertise is in designing algorithms, whether deterministic or ML-based, to maximize the performance of medical devices.
                Take a look at my <a href="../index.html" style="color: white;">projects</a> to get an idea!

            <h2>My Journey</h2>

            <ul>
                <li><b>September 2022</b></li>
                I flew with my labmates to Singapore, to attend the MICCAI 2022 conference, where my Master's Thesis project has
                been <a href="https://conferences.miccai.org/2022/papers/537-Paper2587.html" style="color: white;"> published </a>. Here I had the chance to discuss my work with and to learn from the best scientists and engineers in
                the field of biomedical image and signal processing!
                
                <br/>
                <br/> 
                
                <li><b>August 2022</b></li>
                I move to <span style="color: white;">San Francisco, California</span>, to start working as an algorithms engineer @ neuro42! Here I will have the 
                opportunity to improve the outcomes of a portable and ultra low field MRI, collaborating with physicians, MDs, scientists
                and many engineers from the most different backgrounds.
                
                <br/>
                <br/>   

                <li><b>May 2022</b></li>
                I got my <span style="color: white;">Master's in Bioengineering</span> from the University Of Illinois at Chicago. I submit my Master's thesis research
                to the MICCAI conference, crossing my fingers to go present the work in Singapore!
                
                <br/>
                <br/>   
                             
                <li><b>April 2022</b></li>
                I got my <span style="color: white;">Master's in technologies for Electronics in Biomedical Engineering</span> from Politecnico di Milano. 
                
                <br/>
                <br/>   

                <li><b>September 2021</b></li>
                I start working as a Graduate Researcher at the Connect Lab, between the department of psychiatry and biomedical engineering at UIC. Here I will be
                 working on a project to <span style="color: white;">fuse functional 
                and structural MRI data</span> to further our knoledge of how the human connectome shapes our health state. 
                

                <br/>
                <br/>

                <li><b>January 2021</b></li>
                I move to the windy City, <span style="color: white;">Chicago</span>, to start my US adventure and my Master's at University of Illinois at Chicago!
                
                I am also appointed for the role of <span style="color: white;">Assistant Research Engineer</span> at Shirley Ryan AbilityLab, where I will be working
                for the next few months in creating a pipeline to improve the outcomes of EEG analysis in stroke survivors.
                <br><br>

                <li><b>September 2019</b></li>
                I get my <span style="color: white;"> Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering</span> from Politecnido di Milano, and I apply for the double
                Masters' degree program between Polimi and UIC. 
                
                <br>
                <br>
                <li><b>October 2016</b></li>
                I move to <span style="color: white;">Milan, Italy</span>, to start my journey in the world of Biomedical Engineering, enrolling in a Bachelor Degree at
                Politecnico di Milano.
